# Runbooks

Community driven guides for installing software on different operating systems.

Runbooks is a solution to the "How do I install X on Y problem" that currently involves trawling through inconsistent blog
articles and disparate sources to find the information.

Runbooks may go beyond just "how do I install" and also offer recommendations for installing things "properly". For example:

> How do I install Docker on Ubuntu 16.04

This might contain not only how to install the package but more detailed information about docker user groups etc.

## Notes

- Decide on the format for runbooks. Is it a markdown tutorial or something more brief like a script?
- API
- Some kind of CLI tool to execute a runbook
- Concept of verification. Show the Github contributors.
- Auto testing?
